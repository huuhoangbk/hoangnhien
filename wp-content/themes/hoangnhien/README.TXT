Creative by Nature is a free portfolio theme released by CSSMayo.com and Smashing Magazine

As designers we created a funky theme, particularly considered to designers and we hope you will find it as a flexible and suitable solution to your portfolio needs. Inspired by the lately popular wooden and paper layouts we made a theme that mixes such elements in a cool and funky way.

The theme archive includes all necessary files, server installation guide and help file which describes how to add entries to your portfolio section. In addition a PSD source is available here: http://cssmayo.com/download/free-wordpress-themes/psds/creative-by-nature.psd. We hope you will enjoy the result of our efforts.

The theme is released under GPL. You can use it for all your projects for free and without any restrictions. Please link to http://cssmayo.com/freebies/free-wordpress-themes/creative-by-nature/ if you would like to spread the word. You may modify the theme as you wish.
